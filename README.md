**HR Analytics Project:  Employee Attendance and Leave Patterns Analysis**
---

Welcome to my HR Analytics project, where I leveraged Power BI to conduct a comprehensive analysis of employee attendance and leave patterns within a company. The main objective was to uncover trends and insights that would contribute to more effective workforce management strategies.

**Project Overview**
---
In this project, I harnessed the power of data analytics to gain valuable insights into employee attendance and leave behavior. By analyzing these patterns, I aimed to provide actionable information for optimizing HR processes and enhancing overall workforce productivity.

**Tools and Technologies Used**
---
**Tools:**  Power BI

**Data Source**
---
For this analysis, I worked with an Excel file consisting of three sheets, each containing essential data:

**Employee Presence:**  This sheet held records of employees' attendance at the office.

**Sick Leave:**  It contained information about sick leave taken by employees.

**Work-from-Home Records:**  This sheet recorded instances of employees working remotely.

**Data Preparation and Transformation**
---
My approach to data preparation involved merging and transforming the data from the three sheets within Power BI. This process created a unified and cohesive dataset that formed the basis for subsequent analysis and visualization. By cleaning and structuring the data, I ensured its accuracy and suitability for meaningful insights.

**Key Measures**
---
To provide a holistic assessment of employee attendance and leave patterns, I created key measures:

**Presence %:**  Calculated the percentage of days an employee was present in the company, offering insights into overall attendance.

**Sick Leave %:**  Determined the percentage of days an employee took sick leave, aiding in understanding health-related absence patterns.

**Work from Home %:**  Analyzed the percentage of days an employee worked remotely, contributing to insights about remote work trends.

**Dashboard Creation**
---
Central to the project's success was the development of an interactive dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard showcased the analysis findings through a variety of visually engaging representations, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts. The dashboard enabled stakeholders to comprehensively explore employee attendance and leave patterns.

**Key Insights**
---
**Identified Peak Absence Periods:**  By analyzing sick leave data, I pinpointed specific periods with higher sick leave rates, allowing HR to plan accordingly.

**Evaluated Remote Work Trends:**  Insights into work-from-home patterns provided guidance for structuring remote work policies and evaluating its impact on productivity.

**Informed Resource Allocation:**  The presence percentage shed light on employee availability, facilitating efficient resource allocation.

**Impact and Significance**
---
The HR Analytics project empowered stakeholders to make informed decisions:

**Strategic Workforce Planning:**  The insights gained guided the HR team in optimizing workforce management strategies.

**Enhanced Productivity:**  By addressing absenteeism patterns and leveraging remote work trends, the company could enhance overall employee productivity.

**Data-Driven Decision-Making:**  The interactive dashboard enabled stakeholders to make data-driven decisions in real-time.

**Conclusion**
---
This HR Analytics project exemplifies my proficiency in data analysis and visualization. By employing Power BI, I transformed raw data into actionable insights, equipping stakeholders with the tools needed for effective workforce management and strategic planning.
